\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

This project aims to re-implement Game1, a downloadable shooter game, to make it accessible via web browser. Through this re-implementation, the project aims to alleviate boredom and provide entertainment on a new platform for a wider range of people.  

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}

We are both client and customer for this project. The goal we would like to see realized is for Game1 to be brought to a larger audience through the medium of web browsers. 

\subsubsection{The Customers}

The client and customer for this project are the same.

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}

Other stakeholders of the project include the users, or players, who will consumer our game after it is finished. These may include experienced and inexperienced players. The age range for the players is 7+, for content as well as difficulty. 

Play testers will also be consulted before the project is finished to ensure other people are able to learn how to play the game, to ensure its functionality, and to measure user reactions for game satisfaction requirements. 

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}

Description: The game will be accessible on all browsers that support JavaScript. 
Rationale: JavaScript is a useful language for browser based games and will be supported on a multitude of browsers, increasing the number of players who can access the game. 
Fit Criterion: The game runs properly in all browsers that support JavaScript. 

\subsubsection{Implementation Environment of Current System}

The user will interact with their PC, which will interact with the browser running the game. 
\subsubsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}

Anywhere the user is able to access a computer with an Internet connection is a possible environment for the project. 

\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}

The game and its documentation will be completed on or before December 5th, 2018, as specified by the client.

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

To play the game, the user must have a computer, keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Player character movement is determined by keys on the keyboard, while the trajectory and firing of weapons is controlled by the mouse. A monitor is required to view the game. An Internet connection is also required to play the game, and it is assumed that any browser the user plays the game in will be able to support JavaScript and graphics.  

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}
\subsubsection{The Current Situation}
\textbf{Content} \\
\noindent The current product is a simple Python point-and-shoot game that must be downloaded and compiled in order to be played. \\

\noindent \textbf{Motivation} \\
We want to re-implement this in JavaScript as a web browser game, so that it can be more easily enjoyed by a wider audience. We also wish to make some minor improvements, such as adding a user guide to explain how to play the game, as well as introducing levels in an effort to add complexity and hopefully keep users engaged for longer. 

\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
Some issues with the current game including:

\begin{itemize}
\item With only one character and one stage design, the game is unable to hold interest for long.
\item Its default difficulty exceeds the average player's capabilities.
\item The game lacks any form of instruction, which makes it unfriendly to users.
\item The game was not very portable as it requires the python shell to run.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
Many similar open source shooting games written in JavaScript are available on the Internet. Components in those games, along with the convenient functions in some JavaScript game engines, will be considered as Off-the-Shelf solutions in order to save development time.

\subsection{New Problems}
Currently there are no new problem. This will be updated if new problems are found when we proceed further into the project.

\subsection{Tasks}
\begin{center}
\begin{table}[H]
    \caption{Tasks} 
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
	\hline
	Tasks & Timeline \\ \hline
	Rebuild the game using JavaScript  & Oct 18, 2017 \\ \hline
	Adding features and adjusting difficulty & Oct 20, 2017 \\ \hline
	Finish web page interface & Oct 22, 2017 \\ \hline
	Finish test cases & Oct 24, 2017 \\ \hline
	Finish documentation & Nov 10, 2017 \\ \hline
	Final Demonstration & Nov 27, 2017 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{center}

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
Not applicable to our project.

\subsection{Risks}
The most likely risk for our project would be falling behind schedule and, as a consequence, finding time to make up lost time. 

\subsection{Costs}
There will be no cost as all software we used is free and no external hardware is required for our project.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
No training is required for our project. An instruction on game controls will be provided on the game web page. A thorough game tutorial will be created if our test case indicates that over 50\% of players have difficulty understanding our instructions.

\subsection{Waiting Room}
Not applicable to our project.

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
Learn more about test cases and check test cases for some other game projects.
